# Econommic-Dispatch
Economic dispatch problem at any particlular load with  any number of generating units can be solved by simple lambda iteration technique. This code will be useful to compute the minimu total fuel cost to meet the demand. Transmission losses are neglected.
* It contains both Matlab and Python implementation for the given problem.
